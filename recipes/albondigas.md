## Instructions

> First make the meatballs

> While meatballs bake make the sauce

> Combine meatballs and sauce

### Making the meatballs

1. In a large bowl mix ground beef, egg, parmesan, garlic, parsley, milk, breadcrumbs, nutmeg, pepper, and three pinches of salt. Do not overmix or meat will become tough
  - TODO: What does overmix even mean?
  - TODO: Figure out how many teaspoons of salt, instead of arbitrary pinches
2. Form small balls (golf ball size) in the palm of your hands
3. To Bake: Place balls on baking pan and bake for 15-20 minutes at 350.

### Making the sauce

Make the sauce while the meatballs are baking

1. Dice the tomatoes and onions
2. In a sauce pan, pour olive oil and sweat the onions
3. Once onions are translucent, add the tomatoes
4. Add salt, sugar and basic and mix well. Keep sauce on a low simmer until ready for the meatballs
5. Once meatballs are cooked through in over, add them to sauce and cook together for about 5 minutes. Folt meatballs into sauce gently, careful not to overmix and break the meatballs
6. Sprinkle parsley as garnish on top
7. Enjoy!
